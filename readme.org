In trying to learn tagalog, turns out there aren't all that many anki decks out there.

I have downloaded my decks instead exporting from [[https://www.tagalog.com/flashcards/top_two_thousand_words.php][Top 2,000 Tagalogs Words - Flash Cards]], this includes the audio files, however they are hyperlinks not actual embedded audio files, I want to download and attatch the audio for each card
